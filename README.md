- 👋 Hi, I’m @clawsofthekitten
- 👀 I’m interested in learning all of the things
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the 1000000 ways I can screw up before I am able to code competently
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on...let's not go there yet; give me a year or two to fail first
- 📫 I'll add a contact method once I actually know what I'm doing
